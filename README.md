### Introduction React Admin + Keycloak

This project was designed to be quick and easy to understand.
Furthermore, it was designed to have few files and few dependencies so as to leave everyone the freedom to modify or extend it.

The frontend framework allows you to implement an administrative portal, with the following characteristics

- Using React 18+ with the use of web hooks
- Using Antd to create interfaces
- I use i18n for localization
- Using Vite as a package manager
- Management of authentication on keycloak
